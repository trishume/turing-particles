YAY PARTICLES!

this is a fairly fast particle engine used for teaching particles. Written in turing.

engine-particleclass.t is the main version.
particles-dev.t is the development version that may be slightly messed up or better.

To use it click engine-particleclass.t and copy the code into turing. Or click the downloads button and get everything.
